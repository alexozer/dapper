# ideas

implement on top of bspwm for sanity

internal workspaces
1: monocle main viewing workspace
2: non-monocle workspace for split viewing
3: dummy workspace for gnome-terminal instance
4+: "special" workspaces for other apps

# NEW

By default as nodes are created:
    remove windows from split area
    group on desktop by window class
    focus

When an app's keybinding is pressed
    If a window exists with that class
        if not split
            remove all windows from split area
            switch to that window
        else
            if window class is already a part of a split
                do nothing (split should be focused)
            else
                if currently focused window is not split
                    move it to split space
                assign desired window to split space
    else
        if a virtual app
            do nothing
        else
            launch that app, poll for it in new windows for a while

App bindings:
web browser: i
terminal: n
virtual programs: d and w
