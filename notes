Move statusbar to bottom?
st instead of gnome-terminal for popups?
Alacritty dracula: fix grey / purple color / color of null for jq?

# ideas

implement on top of bspwm for sanity

internal workspaces
1: monocle main viewing workspace
2: non-monocle workspace for split viewing
3: dummy workspace for gnome-terminal instance
4+: "special" workspaces for other apps

# NEW

By default as nodes are created:
    remove windows from split area
    group on desktop by window class
    focus

When an app's keybinding is pressed
    If a window exists with that class
        if not split
            remove all windows from split area
            switch to that window
        else
            if window class is already a part of a split
                do nothing (split should be focused)
            else
                if currently focused window is not split
                    move it to split space
                assign desired window to split space
    else
        if a virtual app
            do nothing
        else
            launch that app, poll for it in new windows for a while

App keybinding pressed
    go to desktop of class

App

App bindings:
web browser: i
terminal: n
virtual programs: d and w

- keep track of which node ids refer to which app
- when focusing an app, go to its desktop and:
    - move all class-matching windows there
    - move away all non-class-matching windows
    - if nothing there, open app (or prompt for which one with dmenu)
- when shift-focusing an app
    - just bring all app windows to current desktop

that's really it!

- Doesn't move all open app windows to app desktop when focusing it
- --pull doesn't work
- Focusing app desktop with multiple windows can cause windows to change orientation
- printing errors about removing desktops even after exited?
